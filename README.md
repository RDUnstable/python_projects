# python_projects
This repository is especially built to store python project files. The folder Chatting includes two files-- me.py and you.py. You can transmit messages from one terminal to other terminal by running the two files 
in two different terminals.

You can also play an interesting game in game.py. But unfortunately it has no proper UI.
scrap.py is used for web scraping.

snake_game.py is coded to run a simple snake game.

The download.py file is used to download videos from the exact video url through a pretty good UI. But remember that you have to extract the video URL
from the HTML source of the video page.
